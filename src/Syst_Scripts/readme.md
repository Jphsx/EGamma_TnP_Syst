The id/iso/sip/vl directories contain 2017 copies of tnp fit script
the base script has no added systematics

Im defining the sytematic labels in this way:

s00 = no changes (standard fit function vpv)
s01 = 30 bins
s02 = 50 bins

s11 = smaller window 30 bin
s12 = smaller window 50 bin

s21 = single gaus 30 bin
s22 = single gaus 50 bin
